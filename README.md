## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 1500 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Installation Process

### 1. Clone GitHub repo for this project locally

First open your terminal and run below this command or download zip 

```
git clone https://github.com/suportdevs/inventory_management.git
```

### Like this

<img src="https://devmarketer.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/github-clone-button.png" width="900">

Once this runs, you will have a copy of the project on your computer.

### 2. cd into your project

You will need to be inside that project file to enter all of the rest of the commands in this tutorial. So remember to type cd projectName to move your terminal working location to the project file we just barely created. (Of course substitute “projectName” in the command above, with the name of the folder you created in the previous step).

### 3. Install Composer Dependencies

```
composer install
or
composer update
```

### 4. Create a copy of your .env file

.env files are not generally committed to source control for security reasons. But there is a .env.example which is a template of the .env file that the project expects us to have. So we will make a copy of the .env.example file and create a .env file that we can start to fill out to do things like database configuration in the next few steps.

### 5. Generate an app encryption key

```
php artisan key:generate
```

### 6. Create an database for our application

```
Database Name inventory_management
```

### 7. In the .env file, add database information to allow Laravel to connect to the database

We will want to allow Laravel to connect to the database that you just created in the previous step. To do this, we must add the connection credentials in the .env file and Laravel will handle the connection from there.

In the .env file fill in the DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, and DB_PASSWORD options to match the credentials of the database you just created. This will allow us to run migrations and seed the database in the next step.

### 8. Migrate the database

```
php artisan migrate
```

### 9. Run this Project

```
php artisan serve
```
